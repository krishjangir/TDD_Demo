#TDD Demo

#Introduction

TDD Demo is an open-source project demonstrating the implementation of Test Driven Development (TDD) principles in a Flutter application. It incorporates essential features such as Dependency Injection, Clean Architecture, Unit Testing, BLoC pattern, and Network API Calling.

#Features

Dependency Injection: Utilizes get_it for managing dependencies in the application.
Clean Architecture: Adheres to clean architecture principles for maintaining separation of concerns and scalability.
Unit Testing: Includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
BLoC (Business Logic Component): Implements the BLoC pattern for managing application state.
Network API Calling: Integrates HTTP package for making network API calls.
